# About Nick Kane

<img src="/assets/about-me/nkane-profile-no-background.png" class="profile-small-img" />
Hi, I'm Nick Kane, a self-taught programmer with a passion for building software that makes an impact. Currently, I'm 
a Staff Engineer, where I specialize in driving innovation and solving complex technical challenges. My journey in 
coding began with curiosity and has evolved into a fulfilling career.

In addition to programming, I practice and teach Jiu-Jitsu as an assistant coach at Valhalla Combat Academy in Southern
Pines, NC. The discipline and resilience I've developed on the mats complement my approach to problem-solving in tech.
I also have a strong interest in game programming, where I blend creativity with technology to create immersive
experiences.

This blog is where I share my thoughts on programming, martial arts, and game development.

Keep hackin'.

Hi, I'm Sugar Kane, Nick Kane's loyal companion. Whether Nick is coding or coaching Jiu-Jitsu, I’m always around, 
enjoying the day. I love relaxing, playing with my favorite toys, and keeping an eye on everything happening around me.

I’m also quite the model! You might have seen me striking a pose in some of Nick's photos. If you like what you see,
you can check out stickers of me available in [Nick's store][sticker-mule]. It’s a fun way to share a bit of my charm
with everyone!
