Growing up outside of Tampa in the late 1990's / early 2000's, I didn't have as much exposure to classic arcades; however, I knew that I loved video games when I was introduced to the id software game [Doom][Doom] on my uncles computer when I was 9 years old. From that point on, I was hooked on any type of gaming.

### Replay Amusement Museum ###
Last weekend I was doing a bit of research on do it yourself arcade cabinet building and repair. I stumbled upon was a place close to where I currently live called ["Replay Amusement Museum"][Replay] located in Tarpon Springs, Florida. After taking a look at their web page, and finding out that the machines were playable for a flat fee. I knew that I would be making a trip out there the following weekend.

### One more game ... ###
Walking in to the a dimly lit room with arcade cabinet speakers blasting, pinball machine paddles clicking, and people laughing - I instantly felt right at home. I started out on the pinball machines, and personally found the classic two paddle machines were a bit more entertaining. Prior to my visit to the Replay Museum, I knew very little about pinball; however, after spending the first hour on a few different machines the mechanics of the game started to click in for me. Two machines that I enjoy playing were ["Xenon"][Xenon] and ["The Machine: Bride of Pin-bot"][Machine-Bride]. Below are a few pictures of some of the pinball machines that I played while at Replay Museum.


#### Xenon ####

This machine was one of my favorites to play during my visit, the artwork had a very science fiction feel to it as well as awesome lighting.

#### The Machine: Bride of Pin-bot ####

Another favorite that I play on my visit, mechanics of this game were fun.

#### Terminator 2 ####

A classic that I could not pass up playing, listening to Arnold's voice yell at you.

#### Hercules ####

Replay Museum had some new machines in there as well, one of which was the Walking Dead! Who could say no to that?!


### Replay Recap ###
Replay Amusement Museum had a lot more to offer than pinball machines, and I did spend a good amount of time playing some classic video games. If you are interested in old school video games and around the Tampa Bay area, I would recommend to take a trip out to Tarpon Springs to play a bunch of awesome games. Keep dreaming in pixels and thanks for reading!
