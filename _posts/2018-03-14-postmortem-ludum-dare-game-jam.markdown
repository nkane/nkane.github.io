If the reader is not aware of what a game jam is, it is a time constraint event that typically provides a theme for game developers
to create a game within the allotted time.

A about a month ago, I was told about a game jam event called "Ludum Dare" by a co-worker. In the past, I had been interested in participating
in a game jam; however, I had never fully committed to the idea of participating in one of these events. When I found out that Ludum Dare
is one of the largest and longest running game jams, I did not want to make any excuses for not participating in a game jam event in 2017. 

Participants of Ludum Dare are giving two different categories, the "Jam" or the "Compo". The main differnece between the two is time allotted
and the ability to work with or without a team. The "Jam" has an allotted time of 72 hours, and allows teams and solo projects. The "Compo"
has an alotted time of 48 hours, and only allows solo projects and all assets are made by the participant as well.
