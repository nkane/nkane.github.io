A game jam is a time constraint event that typically provides a theme for game developers to create a game.

A about a month ago, I was told about a game jam event called "Ludum Dare". In the past, I had been curious and interested in
participating in one. When I found out that Ludum Dare is one of the largest and longest running game jams, I did not want
to make any excuses for not participating in this one.
