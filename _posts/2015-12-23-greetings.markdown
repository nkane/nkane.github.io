Greetings new readers! This post more of an introduction of myself, so please feel free to skip reading this. My name is Nick Kane, and I am a 26 years male residing in Tampa, Florida. I am currently employed at Bloomin' Brands as a "Full Stack Developer" as my first junior position in development; additionally, I do enjoy working on open-source projects outside of daily work. Currently, a big project I am lead developer on is a web application for an e-sports video on demand site [EventVods Github][eventvods]. I am always interested in freelance work, so please feel free to check out my [linkedin profile][linkedin].

Occasionally, I will probably blog about some other areas of interest for me. I am in to weight lifting, jiu-jtisu, mix martial arts, video games, craft beer, video games, and much more.

Thank you for reading!

Nick
