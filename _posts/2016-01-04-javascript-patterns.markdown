If you traveled back in time approximately 6 months ago from the current time of this post and asked me how to manipulate the DOM using basic jQuery or any basic trivial JavaScript questions, I would not be able to answer either of those questions at all. Fast forward to the current time, and I am starting to finally get a pretty decent grasp on using JavaScript for the client-side and the server-side; however, I still consider myself a novice on these topic. As always if you find anything wrong or know of a better/different implementation of something, please send me a email.

Lately, I have been working on a decent amount of JavaScript at work and another outside of work project. In both projects multiple developers are working on the JavaScript code, and I have noticed that none or barely any of the code base are using design patterns.
