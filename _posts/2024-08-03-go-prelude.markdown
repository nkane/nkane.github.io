# Go: Prelude

Over the last seven years of my software engineering career, I have had the fortunate opportunity to work [Go](https://go.dev/).
I have throughly enjoyed working on backend services and developer tools utilizing Go. Since originally learning the language,
I have not spent a lot time reviewing some of the material that was published in books, articles, or videos form. Typically,
I would only start looking in to something when I needed to get familiar with it. This is going to be the first article
in a series of articles that will start my journey to get a breadth of knowledge about the language.

## The Go Programming Language

Luckily, when I first started programming I was introduced to the C programming language within my first year. At that
time I picked up the famous K & R book and read it cover to cover. Most of the information in the book didn't make much
sense to me, and some of the questions in the book were defintely outside of my abilities at the time. When I heard
that [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) co-authored [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/),
I knew that I had to grab a copy of the book. Like most books on my shelf, it's been sitting there for several years
collecting dust and I've never cracked it open. This is my commitment to myself to continue to be the same person I was
years ago when I was first learning, but hopefully be able to give back to the community in some meaningful way in this
series of articles I'll be writing. Anyways, time to get go'in! :)

## Go Go Gadget Go?

Well, I know that this next sentence might horrify a least half of you out there, but one of my favorite qualities of
Go is the syntax similarities to C. Now, I know the other half of you might be screaming that I'm an idiot for even
comparing the two. Chill out, step away from the keyboard, and just touch some grass. Despite the simplicity of the
language syntax, Go is a powerful language and especially good at writing web servers. The standard library is what
most other languages strive to be and provide just the right amount of abstractions to not overwhelm you with
unnecessary complexity.
