A lot has change since my last blog post, so I will start digging into the details! Last September I was still working at Bloomin' Brands full-time. During that time I was interviewing around the area and out of state. Eventually, I started to receive a few job offers around the area and out of state. If you have ever interviewed for a developer position previously, it can be a stressful process depending on how the company operates the interview.

In October I ended up moving to North Carolina to work for a company called Novetta. Moving up here was a huge deal, because I have never lived outside of Florida previously. The last few months have been great working up here, and I have been enjoying it with my faily. The weather is a lot colder than we are all used to, but we have been adjusting to it. Recently, I attended the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) East in Boston with a buddy from work. I have never attended a gaming convention that I wasn't doing production work for, so going to PAX East was a great experience.

I am going to attempt to continue to update this blog with content, but I do not have any road map for the content. I have been streaming games and programming content on Twitch, so maybe I will work out a weekly schedule and post it up.
