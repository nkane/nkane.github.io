Computer graphics programming has always been an interest of mine; however, I would consider the barrier to entry in to the world of computer graphics high.
As a prerequisite in to computer graphics, it is assumed that the individual seeking to study the topic already has a large foundation of knowledge, inclusive of
an intuitive understanding of higher level mathematics and at least a bit of lower level computer programming knowledge (i.e., "lower level" - meaning
understading how the code that is written is used by the particular set of computer hardware that the individual is working with). Although certain people would
argue that you can program graphics without the having a lower level understanding of the computer programming, I will not be using a higher level language in 
this series. It is not my goal with this series to convince anyone not use a higher level programming language for computer graphics. Instead, I would like to
explore my own particular interest using a programming language and toolset that I am confortable with.

### The C Programming Language
The language that I will be using throughout this series is the [C programming language][c-lang]. If you are not familiar with computer programming, a good
place to start would be learning C by picking up a book called ["A First Book of ANSI C"][first-book-of-c], or by watching a course on the web. The book that
I have recommended is the book that I used to initially learn C, so I recommend reading it from cover to cover and completing all of the exercises within it.
In addition here are a few other options that will complement your skills after completing the above:
- [Learn C The Hard way][learn-c-the-hard-way]
- [C Programming Language][k&r]

### Window Command Line Interface (CLI)
At this particular point in time, I am using the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. Windows has a "command prompt" or "CLI" that we will be using to run
particular commands or scripts. The Windows CLI can be accessed by launching the Windows "run" program and typing in "cmd". Find a course on the web, or a tutorial
online to help familiarize yourself with the Windows CLI; additionally, we are going to want to "pin" to the task bar or create a desktop shortcut to the command prompt
for future use. We will be setting up this shortcut to feed in arguments to the CLI program ([cmd.exe][cmd]).
