Growing up outside of Tampa in the late 1990's / early 2000's, I didn't have as much exposure to classic arcades; however, I knew that I loved video games when I was introduced to the id software game [Doom][Doom] on my uncles computer when I was 9 years old. From that point on, I was hooked on any type of gaming.

### Replay Amusement Museum ###
Last weekend I was doing a bit of research on do it yourself arcade cabinet building and repair. One of the things that I stumbled upon was a place close to where I currently live called ["Replay Amusement Museum"][Replay] located in Tarpon Springs, Florida. After taking a look at their web page, and finding out that the machines were playable for a flat fee. I knew that I would be making a trip out there the following weekend.

### One more game ... ###
Walking in to the a dimly lit room with arcade cabinet speakers blasting, pinball machine paddles clicking, and people laughing - I instantly felt right at home.
