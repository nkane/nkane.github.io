<p>A lot has change since my last blog post, so I will start digging into the details! Last September I was still working at Bloomin’ Brands full-time as a .NET developer. During that time I was interviewing around the area and out of state for other software development jobs. Eventually, I started to receive a few job offers around the area and out of state. If you have ever interviewed for a developer position previously, it can be a stressful process depending on how the company operates the interview.</p>
