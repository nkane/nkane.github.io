I"+<p>Computer graphics programming has always been an interest of mine; however, I would consider the barrier to entry in to the world of computer graphics high.
As a prerequisite in to computer graphics, it is assumed that the individual seeking to study the topic already has a large foundation of knowledge, inclusive of
an intuitive understanding of higher level mathematics and at least a bit of lower level computer programming knowledge (i.e., “lower level” - meaning
understanding how the code that is written is used by the particular set of computer hardware that the individual is working with). Although certain people would
argue that you can program graphics without the having a lower level understanding of the computer programming, I will not be using a higher level language in 
this series. It is not my goal with this series to convince anyone not use a higher level programming language for computer graphics. Instead, I would like to
explore my own particular interest using a programming language and tool set that I am comfortable with.</p>
