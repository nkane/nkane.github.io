<p>A lot has change since my last blog post, so I will start digging into the details! Last September I was still working at Bloominâ€™ Brands full-time as a .NET developer. During that time I was interviewing around the area and out of state for other software development jobs. Eventually, I started to receive a few job offers around the area and out of state. If you have ever interviewed for a developer position previously, it can be a stressful process depending on how the company operates the interview.</p>

<p>In October I ended up moving to North Carolina to work for a company called Novetta. Moving up here was a huge deal, because I have never lived outside of Florida previously. The last few months have been great working up here, and I have been enjoying it with my family. The weather is a lot colder than we are all used to, but we have been adjusting to it. Recently, I attended the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) East in Boston with a buddy from work. I have never attended a gaming convention that I wasnâ€™t doing production work for, so going to PAX East was a great experience. I love video games, and I would eventually like to start writing game engines.</p>

<p>I am going to attempt to continue to update this blog with content, but I do not have any road map for the content. I have been streaming games and programming content on Twitch and adding it to youtube, so maybe I will work out a weekly schedule and post it up on the blog. I will figure something out within the upcoming weeks. The stream should be back up and running by Thursday, March 16th, 2017. Feel free to join in on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nkanedev">stream</a> or checkout the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCG0iK4T34xo3Q4RzKShcQw">VODs</a>.</p>
