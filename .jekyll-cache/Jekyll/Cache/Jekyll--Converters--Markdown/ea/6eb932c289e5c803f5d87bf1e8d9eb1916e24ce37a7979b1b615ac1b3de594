I"§<p>Growing up outside of Tampa in the late 1990‚Äôs / early 2000‚Äôs, I didn‚Äôt have as much exposure to classic arcades; however, I knew that I loved video games when I was introduced to the id software game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">Doom</a> on my uncles computer when I was 9 years old. From that point on, I was hooked on any type of gaming.</p>

<p>Last weekend I was doing a bit of research on do it yourself arcade cabinet building and repair. I stumbled upon was a place close to where I currently live called <a href="http://www.replaymuseum.org/">‚ÄúReplay Amusement Museum‚Äù</a> located in Tarpon Springs, Florida. After taking a look at their web page, and finding out that the machines were playable for a flat fee. I knew that I would be making a trip out there the following weekend.</p>

<h3 id="one-more-game-">One more game ‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>Walking in to the a dimly lit room with arcade cabinet speakers blasting, pinball machine paddles clicking, and people laughing - I instantly felt right at home. I started out on the pinball machines, and personally found the classic two paddle machines were a bit more entertaining. Prior to my visit to the Replay Museum, I knew very little about pinball; however, after spending the first hour on a few different machines the mechanics of the game started to click in for me. Two machines that I enjoy playing were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_(pinball)">‚ÄúXenon‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine:_Bride_of_Pin-Bot">‚ÄúThe Machine: Bride of Pin-bot‚Äù</a>. Below are a few pictures of some of the pinball machines that I played while at Replay Museum.</p>

This machine was one of my favorites to play during my visit, the artwork had a very science fiction feel to it as well as awesome lighting.</p>

Replay Museum had some new machines in there as well, one of which was the Walking Dead! Who could say no to that?!</p>

<h3 id="replay-recap">Replay Recap</h3>
<p>Replay Amusement Museum had a lot more to offer than pinball machines, and I did spend a good amount of time playing some classic video games. If you are interested in old school video games and around the Tampa Bay area, I would recommend to take a trip out to Tarpon Springs to play a bunch of awesome games. Keep dreaming in pixels and thanks for reading!</p>
