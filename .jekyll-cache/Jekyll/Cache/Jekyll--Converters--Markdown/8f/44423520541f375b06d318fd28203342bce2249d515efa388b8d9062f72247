I"…<p>Growing up outside of Tampa in the late 1990â€™s / early 2000â€™s, I didnâ€™t have as much exposure to classic arcades; however, I knew that I loved video games when I was introduced to the id software game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">Doom</a> on my uncles computer when I was 9 years old. From that point on, I was hooked on any type of gaming.</p>
