I"D<p>If you traveled back in time approximately 6 months ago from the current time of this post and asked me how to manipulate the DOM using basic jQuery or any basic trivial JavaScript questions, I would not be able to answer any of those questions at all. Fast forward to the current time, and I am starting to finally get a pretty decent grasp on using JavaScript for the client-side and the server-side; however, I still consider myself a novice on these topic and would like to set up my JavaScript skills.</p>

<p>As I learn new frameworks or interesting information, I will write a brief article about what I learned to spread the knowledge on this JavaScript Quest. If you find anything wrong or know of a better/different implementation of something, please send me a email and I will be sure to write about it.</p>
